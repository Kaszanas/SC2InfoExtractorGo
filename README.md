# SC2InfoExtractorGo

A tool meant to allow for quick data extraction from StarCraft 2 replay files ".SC2Replay".

## Example Usage

The easiest way to run this tool is to use the provided Docker image release. Please note that the `maps` directory can be mounted to see what map files are downloaded, and what map files were pre-seeded with the Docker Image. Other command line options are described in [CLI Options](#cli-options). Command below showcases the exampe usage of the tool.

```sh
docker run -it --rm \
  -v </path/to/your/replays>:/app/replays/input \
  -v </path/to/your/output>:/app/replays/output \
  -v </path/to/your/maps>:/app/maps \
  sc2infoextractorgo:latest -help
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you wish to see other files that are generated by the tool, you will have to mount the appropriate directories. The tool generates logs in the `logs` directory.

Alternatively, you can [compile the tool from source](#build-from-source) and run it directly on your machine.

## CLI Options

The following flags are available:

```
  -help
    Show command usage
  -game_mode_filter int
    Specifies which game mode should be included from the processed files
    in a format of a binary flag: AllGameModes: 0b11111111 (default 0b11111111) (default 255)
  -input string
    Input directory where .SC2Replay files are held. (default "./replays/input")
  -log_dir string
    Specifies directory which will hold the logging information. (default "./logs/")
  -log_level int
    Specifies a log level from 1-7:
    Panic - 1, Fatal - 2,
    Error - 3, Warn - 4,
    Info - 5, Debug - 6,
    Trace - 7 (default 4)
  -max_procs int
    Specifies the number of logic cores of a processor that will be used for processing (default runtime.NumCPU()). (default 24)
  -number_of_packages int
    Provide a number of zip packages to be created and compressed
    into a zip archive. Please remember that this number needs to be lower
    than the number of processed files. If set to 0, will ommit the
    zip packaging and output .json directly to drive. (default 1)
  -only_map_download
    Flag specifying if the tool is supposed to only download
    the maps and not process the replays.
  -output string
    Output directory where compressed zip packages will be saved. (default "./replays/output")
  -perform_chat_anonymization
    Flag, specifying if the chat anonymization should be performed.
  -perform_cleanup
    Flag specifying if the tool is supposed to perform the cleaning
    functions within the processing pipeline.
  -perform_filtering
    Flag, specifying if the pipeline ought to verify different hard coded game modes.
    If set to false completely bypasses the filtering.
  -perform_integrity_checks
    Flag specifying if the software is supposed to check the hardcoded
    integrity checks for the provided replays
  -perform_player_anonymization
    Flag specifying if the tool is supposed to perform player anonymization
    functions within the processing pipeline.
    If set to true please remember to download and run
    an anonymization server: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5138313
  -perform_validity_checks
    Flag, specifying if the tool is supposed to use hardcoded validity checks
    and verify if the replay file variables are within 'common sense' ranges.
  -with_cpu_profiler string
    Set path to the file where pprof cpu profiler will save its information.
    If this is empty no profiling is performed.
```

### Minimal Example

1. Place ```.SC2Replay``` files in ```./replays/input```
2. Run ```SC2InfoExtractorGo.exe``` as follows:

```bash
SC2InfoExtractorGo.exe -input ./replays/input -output ./replays/output
```

3. Verify the output in ```./replays/output```
4. If The output packages do not contain any processed replays, proceed to verify ```./logs/```.

### Dataset Preparation

If You have a pack of replays with nested directories and You would like to automatically flatten the directory structure, We have published a tool that can be used for that, please see SC2DatasetPreparator: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5296664

### Anonymization (Optional)

In order to anonymize the replays please make sure to download and run our open-source implementation of an anonymization server the SC2AnonServerPy: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5138313

This is required because of the multiprocessing nature of our code that needs to perform synchronization with an existing database of unique toons (player IDs) that are mapped to arbitrary incrementing integer.

### Map Translation Support

Existing implementation downloads the maps from the Blizzard servers. This is to normalize the map names to English language. When there is no internet connection available, our tool should fallback to reading the map names from the files placed in the ```./maps``` directory.

### Filtering Capabilities

Currently the software supports some game mode filtering capabilities which can be used with ```-game_mode``` flag.
The flag itself is a binary flag where ```0b11111111``` is all game modes which is the default.

Other ways to set the flag:
- ```0b00000001```: 1v1 Ranked Games
- ```0b00000010```: 2v2 Ranked Games
- ```0b00000100```: 3v3 Ranked Games
- ```0b00001000```: 4v4 Ranked Games
- ```0b00010000```: 1v1 Custom Games
- ```0b00100000```: 2v2 Custom Games
- ```0b01000000```: 3v3 Custom Games
- ```0b10000000```: 4v4 Custom Games
